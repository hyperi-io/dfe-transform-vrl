//! The naming and cleanup convention for containers this suite starts.
//!
//! Several runs share a developer machine, so a container has to say what it is,
//! which suite started it, and whose run owns it -- otherwise `docker ps` shows a
//! wall of random hex and nobody can tell what is safe to remove. These tests
//! pin the scheme so it cannot drift back to testcontainers' defaults.
//!
//! The naming cases need nothing and always run. The one that starts a REAL
//! container is `#[ignore]`, matching the rest of this binary: a default CI run
//! here must not reach for a broker at all.
